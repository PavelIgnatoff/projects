I know sometimes we can get stuck on our code from time to time. It's ok and perfectly normal. However, it is important to stay motivated in your work. Don't give up if your code fails....research, research, research until you find your answer. 9/10 someone else has had the same problem and there is an answer for it. Keep pushing and keep your motivation moving forward!!???? @pie_thon.io
